## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- pnpm package manager
- PostgreSQL database (Neon)
- Clerk account for authentication

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database"

# Clerk Authentication
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="clerk_secret_key_here"
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="clerk_publishable_key_here"

# Additional Clerk Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL="/sign-up"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL="/"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL="/"

# Vercel (Optional for deployment)
VERCEL_URL="your-app.vercel.app"
```

#### Database URL Format
For Neon PostgreSQL, your `DATABASE_URL` should follow this format:
```
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon-hostname]/[database]?sslmode=require
```

### Drizzle ORM Configuration

The project uses Drizzle ORM for database operations with the following configuration:

#### drizzle.config.ts
```typescript
import type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit';

export default {
  schema: './lib/db.ts',
  out: './drizzle',
  driver: 'pg',
  dbCredentials: {
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL as string,
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

#### Database Schema
The schema is defined in `lib/db.ts` and includes tables for:
- Users
- Projects
- Newsletter subscribers
- Role management

#### Migrations
To set up your database:

1. **Initialize the database**:
   ```powershell
   pnpm run db:generate
   ```

2. **Run migrations**:
   ```powershell
   pnpm run db:migrate
   ```

3. **Push schema changes** (during development):
   ```powershell
   pnpm run db:push
   ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Set up environment variables in `.env` file
4. Initialize and migrate database with `pnpm run db:generate` and `pnpm run db:migrate`
5. Start the development server with `pnpm run dev`
